# programming language
## What is programming language
- It is language which helps to communicate with computers{They are not able to understand human languages}
- Computers have many languages
	- Assembly, C, C++, Java, JavaScript
- Prog lang helps to write programs using those languages.

- With those steps Programs do a specific task correctly.
# History of python
## Evolution of I/O{input/output}
- Early in the history of computing, programs were submitted on punch cards with all the data they required and executed together with other programs that used the same libraries.Output was to a line printer.
- Later dev'ts introduces interactive processing which allowed the user to provide data while the program was running .This normally takes place  in a question and answer format.
## Generation of Computers 
1. First Generation: Vacuum Tubes == > Punch cards.
2. Second Gen : Transistor ==> Programming started here with assembly.
3. Third gen: Integrated circuits ==> Basic, cobol, pascial, Fintan, C, C++, Perl and ada
4. Forth gen: Microprocessors  ==> python, sql, Matlab
5. Fifth gen: AI
